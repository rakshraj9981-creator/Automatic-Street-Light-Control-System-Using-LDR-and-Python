# Automatic-Street-Light-Control-System-Using-LDR-and-Python
This project demonstrates an Automatic Street Light Control System that turns street lights ON during night and OFF during daytime based on ambient light intensity.  The logic is implemented using basic Python, simulating real-world sensor input (LDR).
